  <description>&lt;title&gt;Notes&lt;/title&gt;&lt;font&gt;Small&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Bug Fixes&lt;/title&gt;&lt;font&gt;Tiny&lt;/font&gt;
- Fixed bug where immoveable vehicles would share regions with moveable ones, causing some vehicles to not update the regions / pathgrid throughout the game.

- Fixed bug where modifying movement permissions wouldn't recache owners of regions.

- Fixed bug where an idle vehicle would still render a tiny line to its current position.

- Fixed bug where vehicle turrets capable of non-LOS aiming would still require LOS for auto-targeting.

- Fixed bug where vehicle turrets would auto-target outside their limits of fire.

- Fixed bug where vehicle turrets would auto-target outside their min / max range.

- Fixed bug where overlays layered beneath the vehicle would still render on top of the vehicle in UI.
&lt;title&gt;Performance Changes&lt;/title&gt;&lt;font&gt;Tiny&lt;/font&gt;
- Optimized pathgrid updating when snowing

- Optimized memory usage for dedicated thread requests

- Optimized pawn overlay rendering in vehicles.  This should now be no more costly than vanilla pawn rendering.
&lt;title&gt;Additional Changes&lt;/title&gt;&lt;font&gt;Tiny&lt;/font&gt;
- Added 'deploy' mechanic where vehicles will need to set up before being able to use its turrets.

- When landing at a map, if no edge or center cell is found it will now default to forced targeting.

- When landing and in 'forced targeting', right clicking (or your cancel keybind) will allow you to exit out to the world map should you be unable to land on the map.

- Added toggle for rendering where aerial vehicles are landing

- Added 'friendly fire' field in the mod settings for running over pawns.  This will allow you to keep the mechanic enabled without being forced to deal with accidentally running over friendlies.

- Added ring radius when targeting with turrets that have spread.

- Added overlay rendering linked up to a component, allowing overlays to render based on the component's health.

- Added one shot flecks to launch protocol animations, allowing for single-instance flecks being emitted at a specific frame in the animation.
&lt;title&gt;Final Notes&lt;/title&gt;&lt;font&gt;Tiny&lt;/font&gt;
