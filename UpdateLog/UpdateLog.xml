Woohoo! Vehicle Framework is now updated for 1.5 and the Anomaly DLC.

To celebrate the release of a new DLC, I've added 'upgrade' mechanics. This allows modders to create upgrade trees for their vehicles.

&lt;i&gt;What does that mean? Can I make my vehicle go faster?&lt;/i&gt;
Yup! There are tons of things that can be upgraded such as stats, armor, and even adding / swapping / removing turrets.  I won't list them all since it would take up a lot of space but it's very expansive so if modders make the effort to add them, expect some cool upgrade trees to customize your vehicles.

&lt;i&gt;What about raiders? I thought those were coming first?&lt;/i&gt;
I'm working on it I promise. I have the groundwork laid out for raider AI which is proving to be very time consuming. So I figured I'd spend a little time and give you guys something cool to play around with while I work on raiders :P

When I do have the first iteration of raider AI finished, it will be an opt-in feature that you can enable in the mod settings. I'll post more info about it in a future update.

P.S. River travel is now enabled, go crazy.
