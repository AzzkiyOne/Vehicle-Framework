	<description><![CDATA[<b><color=orange>The Vehicle Framework</color></b>
Welcome to the official Closed Beta for my work in progress framework.

I am using this steam upload to allow for quick and easy updates to a larger audience of testers.

If you are not already part of the discord, please join us! It is much easier for me to communicate future plans, bugfixes, and changes to the framework as I make progress.

This mod is explicitly for <b>testing only</b> so if you are attempting to use this in your own save file to play with, it's at your own risk. I frequently make game breaking updates due to new features and changes to existing core mechanics. You've been warned.

If you have ideas, feedback, or a bug to report, please head on over to the GitHub Issues page (link is provided in the steam workshop description) and make an appropriate ticket there.]]>
