Welcome to the official &lt;color=cyan&gt;Closed Beta&lt;/color&gt; for Vehicles.

This marks an official turning point for Vehicles as this mod will remain on the workshop until a full-release is in order. I will use this mod for testing purposes in order to iron out the bugs before I create a full release. 

This is a limited access beta with certain features disabled until they receive further work such as incidents, raiders, trader caravans, air defenses, and fishing compatibility.

If you have ideas, feedback, or a bug to report, please head on over to the GitHub Issues page (link is provided in the steam workshop description) and make an appropriate ticket there.
