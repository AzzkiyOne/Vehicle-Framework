<anchor>MiddleCenter</anchor><b>Welcome to the Vehicles - Beta Release</b><anchor>MiddleLeft</anchor><font>Tiny</font>
Despite being beta #2, this marks the first official closed beta. 
Mechanics should be fully functional but do expect there to be bugs so I really hope you're not using this with precious save files.

Please report any bugs you might have on the <link>https://github.com/SmashPhil/Vehicles/issues</link>(Github Issues Page).<s/>You must provide the <b>full logs</b> (hugslib link is preferable but I'll take pastebin too).

If you have feedback to give regarding balancing for the full release you can drop it in the discord chat.
If you don't want to wait for me to balance it you can always change the values in the mod settings.

I will not be taking any feature requests at this time for new mechanics or ThingComps (mostly looking at you vehicle modders... don't even think about it)
I'll be taking requests when mechanics are fully fixed and raiders / traders are nearly complete.

Happy Hunting!
