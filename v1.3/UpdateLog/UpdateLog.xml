  <description>[title]Recent News[/title][font]Small[/font]
I've started a [link]https://www.patreon.com/smashphil[/link](Patreon) for Vehicles development.

I've decided to quit my full-time job as a Software Engineer to pursue my dream job of being a game developer. This is actually something I've been thinking about for many months. I'll be switching from part-time work to full-time work on [link]https://discord.gg/vU4NDmsfpw[/link](Cursed Crew) (my own game I'm making with Oskar and Roolo whom you all probably know) which means I'll have an extra allotted 20-30 hours per week to work on whatever else.

Now this could mean I pick up contract work as a Software Engineer, or it could mean I spend those 30 hours on Vehicles. I'd like to spend it on Vehicles, so I set up a patreon for those that would like to support the additional work on it. This is entirely optional and I'm grateful for anyone who decides they would like to support the project.

Thank you in advance to those of you that choose to support me on this journey :)
[font]Tiny[/font][title]Bug Fixes[/title]
Fixed compatibility issue with Nature's Pretty Sweet, despawning objects immediately after spawning on lava while still triggering VehicleRegions to generate.

Fixed bug where AerialVehicles on the world map would still render with lighting when zoomed out.

[title]Additional Changes[/title]
Changed the UpdateLog to now allow multiple mods to throw update notifications, allowing the user to page through all updates. I'll release this modder tool at a later time for other modders.
