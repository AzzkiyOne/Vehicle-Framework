[font]Tiny[/font][title]Bug Fixes[/title]
Fixed bug where pawns previously assigned seats in dialog for a specific vehicle would also be able to be reassigned for the same caravan in another vehicle.

Fixed bug where vehicle turrets could auto target without turret roles satisfied or turret disabled entirely.

Fixed bug where vehicle material would render the North mask but the texture would be the default displayed rotation.

Fixed bug where overlays with non-mask graphics would render semi-transparent
[title]New Additions[/title]
VehicleDefs can now accept a display rotation in the drawProperties to specify which rotation of the vehicle to show when rendering for certain icons like the build gizmo or in the upgrade tree. The ColorPicker and ModSettings will also now allow you to rotate the vehicle to see how each rotation looks.

Areas may now be configured to add or substract pathCosts from the area. This is for path finding only and will not affect speed, but allows for vehicles to be given preferred areas to path through, or areas that are restricted altogether.

Added quick ColorPicker menu for Areas to allow you to change the color.
[title]Additional Changes[/title]
Rearranged Dialog_AssignSeats for better user interaction between dragging and dropping seat assigning.

Moved the rename and recolor buttons to the inspect pane of the vehicle (the little window in the bottom left that pops up when you select something). This will make it much easier to find and navigate to without it being hidden behind some ITab.

Refactored Settings draw properties to work as a generic "display" setting for the size and offset of the vehicle. Thus, these 2 fields will apply to anywhere the vehicle is displayed in UI.
